	Tozasareteku taiyou sagashi ni tabidatou
The sun hides itself away
And we go in pursuit

	Nakushita yume wo torimodosu tame
'Cause there's a dream we want to find again
	Mienai chikara ni ima michibikareru mama
There's a power hidden deep inside
And it's guiding our way
	Haruka tooku no gooru mezashite
Our goal's far off in the distance

	Mishiranu machi bokura wa doko e yukeba ii n darou
Lost in a town we've never seen
Not sure which way to turn
	Takanaru mune mayowazu hashiri tsuzuketai (ah-i-a-i-a-i-a-i-a)
But our hearts will never falter
They tell us whithe path to take!

	Inochi wo kakete idomu I can fly kowai mono nante nai
I can fly!
We spread our wings with our lives on the line
Nothing in our way's gonna stop us now
	Hadaka no kokoro to kokoro de tsunagatteitai yo
Our souls laid bare to one another
I wanna fly now with you
	Kibou no hikari kanji in the sky dare yori mo takaku tobe
Enter the light!
Borne aloft by wings of hope
Soaring above beyond our wildest dreams
	Me no mae no unmei kirihirake owaru koto nai mirai e
Our destiny lies before us
Stretching onward
For us to claim

Take to the sky
