	Ayatsurareteku unmei ga kanashimi no soko de kamawanai
I'm nothing but a pawns
No fate of my own
But I can survive in sorrow
	Tsunagareta ito anata e to tsuzuku karami hodoite suki ni shite yo
For we're bound
You and me together
Our destinies tied by the love we share
	Heart ugokasareteru hodo itami hashiru no
And the pain
The hurt I feel inside
Drives me to stand up and fight

	Endless mezameru omoi ni kokyuu sae dekinai
Feelings
Welling up in my heart
I can't breathe for this feeling

	Anata wo mamoreru nara karada kuchihatete mo ii
All I want is to see you safe
I'd let my body wither away for you
	Ai no akashi wo daita watashi wo mitete
I embrace the love within me
Yes, here I am
	Mune ni te wo oshitsukete eien sagashiteru no
Lay a hand upon my breast
In search of eternity
	Itsumo hitori ni shinaide
I'm begging, don't leave me alone
	Watashi no subete wa sou anata kara hajimaru
All that I am
I am because of you
